4. I can do all of the above, and I can use some of all of the following: the ternary operator, `async`/`await`, `try`/`catch`, and/or optional chaining.

### NPM & Create-React-App

- Front End

0. I am unfamiliar with using `npm`, `package.json`, and the `create-react-app` utility.
1. I can use the `create-react-app` utility in my terminal to spin up a new boilerplate React project.
2. I can use the `create-react-app` utility in my terminal to spin up a new boilerplate React project. I can use `npm start` to run a server that will compile/run my code and render my UI on the browser page**.** I can use `npm install` , `package.json`, and commands like `npm outdated` to manage project dependencies and troubleshoot issues with them.
3. I can do all of the above, and I can add my own React component(s) to `App.js`. I can add static files (such as images) to my `public` folder and import them.
4. I can do all of the above, and I can modify `create-react-app` defaults to customize my application.

### Passing Props and Using State

- Front End

0. I am unfamiliar with how to create a component using JSX in React.
1. I can create a functional component in a new `.js` file using arrow function syntax then export it and import it into `App.js` so I can see the new component in my UI on the browser page.
2. I can pass data from `App.js` to my component by using props and render the data from props in my UI on the browser page. I can track the state of the App component with the `useState` hook.
3. I can do all of the above and conditionally render two components in `App.js` depending on the state of the App component.
4. I can do all of the above, and I can modify the state of a parent component from a child component by passing a `useState` function through props.

### The React LifeCycle and AJAX

- Front End

0. I am unfamiliar with making API requests in a React application.
1. I can install and use a library like `axios` to make HTTPS requests inside of my React application. I can use `axios.get()` to make a request to a URL and and return the data from the response in a promise.
2. I can install and use a library like `axios` to make HTTPS requests inside of my React application. I can use `axios.get()` to make a request to a URL and and return the data from the response in a promise. I can use the `useEffect` hook to ensure the data from my request renders to the UI after my component has mounted to the DOM.
3. I can do all of the above and add a dependency array as an optional second argument to my `useEffect` hook to keep my component from continuously making API calls or re-rendering in my UI.
4. I can do all of the above and use data from props or state in the dependency array that will trigger my `useEffect` hook to run again if the data changes.

### React Router

- Front End

0. I am unfamiliar with React Router.
1. I can use the `<Router>` component and the `<Route>` from `react-router-dom` to keep my UI in sync with the browser URL.
2. I can use the `<Router>` component and the `<Route>` from `react-router-dom` to keep my UI in sync with the browser URL. I can use the `Switch` component in conjunction with the `Route` component to render the first component that matches an exact path. I can use the `path` and `component` or `render`  props on the `Route` component that will mount a component to the DOM depending on the path that I have assigned as a value to the `path` prop.
3. I can do all of the above, and I can use the `<Link>` component to create links to different routes for navigation around my React application. I can use the `<Redirect>` component to navigate to a new location based on a condition like whether or not a user is logged in to my React application.
4. I can do all of the above, and I can use the `useHistory` hook from `react-router-dom` to access my browser's location history. I can use the `.push()` method from `useHistory` to navigate my user to a different route after a form has been submitted.


### DRF Authentication and Authorization

- Back End

0. I am unfamiliar with authentication and authorization in Django REST Framework.
1. I can set up basic authentication using the `djoser` library and DRF authentication classes.
2. I can set up basic and token authentication using the `djoser` library and DRF authentication classes. I can manage access using DRF permissions classes such as `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`.
3. I can set up basic and token authentication using DRF authentication classes and manage access using DRF permissions classes such as `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`. I can set specific permission and authentication classes per-view or per-viewset.
4. I can do all of the above, and I can do some or all of the following: use `django-allauth` to allow third-party login; use JSON Web Token authentication with `djoser` or `djangorestframework-simplejwt`; customize the `UserModel` to use email instead of username for authentication.
